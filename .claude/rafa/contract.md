# rafa brain contract — v1

The strict protocol every brain file obeys, and the `manifest.json` the platform
ingests. This is the **single source of truth** shared by the writers (atlas, bloom,
prism) and the reader (the platform ingest). If a file violates this, the compile
step **fails loudly** and the authoring agent must correct it — the platform never
guesses, never assumes a value.

**Canonical home: `.claude/rafa/contract.md` in the CODE repo** (blueprint split,
0.4.0) — the contract versions with the CLI that implements it (`rafa compile` ships
inside `@rafinery/cli`, never vendored). A **stamped copy** rides every brain push as
`contract.md` in the brain repo, so any reader of the brain repo knows which contract
version that brain conforms to.

Pipeline:

```
agents write .md (frontmatter per this contract)
  → rafa okf       (deterministic OKF surface, §11: stamp derivable fields,
                    transpile [[wikilinks]], render # Citations, index tree)
  → rafa compile   (deterministic: parse frontmatter, VALIDATE, fail loudly —
                    the emitted surface is gated like any authored file)
       ├ FAIL → structured error (file · field · rule) → author agent fixes → retry
       └ PASS → emit manifest.json
  → git push → webhook → INGEST = JSON.parse(manifest) + shape-check → Convex
  → query APIs (per repo+branch) → platform renders
```

Two enforcement points: **compile-time** (structure — this contract) and **prism**
(semantics — truth of the content). Structure is validated _before_ semantics.

## File-type registry — every `.rafa` file has a declared class

No consumer ever guesses. **Every** file type is classified here; a `structured` type has
a schema (parse it), a `verbatim` type is prose (display it, never parse for data), a
`generated` type is machine-written by a named tool. If a file matching a `structured` path
doesn't validate, compile fails.

The `agent` type is the one structured type outside `.rafa/`: the shipped agent cards
in the code repo. Compile validates them (§10) so a malformed card fails the gate like
any other contract violation, but they are never emitted into `manifest.json` — the
platform doesn't ingest agents (yet); the gate exists so the agents themselves are
never un-schema'd. The SOPs the cards point at are committed skills in the code repo
(`.claude/skills/rafa-*/SKILL.md`); the gate tools are `@rafinery/cli` commands —
neither lives under `.rafa/`, which holds purely knowledge + state.

`structured` types are compiled into `manifest.json` (§1) — that JSON is the ONLY thing the
platform ingests. `verbatim`/`generated` files are shown as-is in the file browser (fetched
lazily), never parsed. A file under a `structured` path that isn't in this table → compile
error (no rogue unschema'd data files).

---

## 0. Global rules

- **Frontmatter is the only machine-read surface.** The markdown **body is prose**
  and is NEVER parsed for data. Every value the platform shows comes from frontmatter
  (via the compiled manifest), or from the body rendered _verbatim_ (never scraped).
- **`schemaVersion` is required** on every file and in the manifest. Unknown version
  → ingest reports an error, does not guess.
- **`id` is required and stable.** It MUST equal the filename stem (`foo.md` → `foo`).
  Renames are safe because rows are keyed by `id`, not path.
- **Required fields are required.** Missing/empty required field = compile failure.
  The validator **never fills a default for a required field** — that would be
  assuming. Optional fields have documented defaults.
- **Enums are closed.** A value outside the enum = compile failure (not coerced).

### Frontmatter grammar (strict subset — the only shapes allowed)

Frontmatter is a leading `---` … `---` block. Within it, only these forms are legal;
anything else is a compile error:

```yaml
key: scalar                       # string | number | true | false
key: "quoted string"              # quotes stripped
key: [a, b, c]                    # flow list of scalars
key: { a: x, b: y }               # flow map of scalars
key:                              # block list …
  - item
  - item
key: >-                           # folded scalar: continuation lines joined with one space
  first part
  second part
```

No nested block maps, no anchors, no literal (`|`) blocks. The folded scalar (`>-`/`>`)
is the ONLY multiline form, added for agent cards (§10) whose descriptions fold.
Deterministic to parse: indented non-empty lines after `>-` join with a single space.

### cites DSL

Each cite is one string: `` `<path>:<line> :: <token>` ``

- split on the **first** `::` → (`left`, `token`)
- in `left`, split on the **last** `:` → (`path`, `line`)
- `line` is digits (`"42"`) or a range (`"14-18"`)

Compile parses each into `{ file, line, token }`. A cite that doesn't match → error.

      "lens": "product", // transitional mirror of category (pre-2026-07-26 name) — dropped with the backfill arc
      "status": "open", // open | backlog | fixed | wontfix
      "title": "…",
      "summary": "…",
      "fix": "…",
      "leverage": { "impact": "high", "effort": "low" }, // impact/effort ∈ low|medium|high

      "cites": [{ "file": "…", "line": "25", "token": "…" }],
      "path": "improve/improvements/dead-model-options-google-crewai.md",
    },
  ],
}
```

**The manifest carries KNOWLEDGE only.** Plans and the active pointer left it
(0.4.0 — the plans channel, §7): they are pushed on approval via `push_plan` /
`set_active_plan` and never ride the brain repo. Legacy manifests carrying
`plans[]`/`activePlanId` are tolerated and IGNORED by ingest (never written).

Ingest is `JSON.parse` + a shape-check against this schema. Any mismatch (missing
key, wrong enum, wrong type, unknown `schemaVersion`) → a **surfaced ingest error**
on the platform, never a guessed value.

**Size stamps (`bodyTokens`, `cites[].targetTokens`) are ADDITIVE OPTIONAL.** compile
stamps each note's body-token estimate and, per cite, the cited file's token estimate —
both `ceil(chars/4)`, computed deterministically at compile time (no LLM, no network) to
feed the platform's recall-savings estimator. `targetTokens` is **omitted** for any cite
whose target is unreadable at compile (honest absence — never a guessed `0`). Because
these fields are purely additive and optional, `schemaVersion` **stays 1**: ingest never
refuses a manifest for lacking them, so a legacy manifest produced without them (or with
some cites carrying no `targetTokens`) remains valid. The shape-check treats them as
optional and tolerates their absence.

## 2. Note files — `brain/rules/*.md`, `brain/playbooks/*.md`

`kind` is derived from the directory (`rules/` → `rule`, `playbooks/` → `playbook`).

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
id: agent-name-contract # required · == filename stem
type: contract # required · contract | convention | flow | how-to
domain: web-agent-bridge # required · non-empty
title: The agent name is a cross-process contract # required
summary: Only "research_agent" is fully wired end to end # required
links: [copilotkit-runtime-route-convention] # optional · default []
failure: silent # optional · silent | loud
anchor:
  research_agent # optional · checker gate B2: EVERY code hit of this
  #   token must be a cited site (`anchor: none` = explicit
  #   exemption for composition/ordering contracts)
absent:
  legacy_agent_name # optional · checker gate B3: this token must appear
  #   NOWHERE in code (docs/.md excluded) — declare one for
  #   every claim that depends on something NOT existing;
  #   the checker re-greps it every run, so the claim can
  #   never silently go stale. Repeatable (one per line).
cites: # required · ≥ 1
  - src/lib/model-selector-provider.tsx:42 :: research_agent
  - agents/python/main.py:20 :: research_agent
---
（prose body — rendered verbatim, never parsed）
```

`anchor:`/`absent:` are **checker declarations** (consumed by `rafa verify-citations`
gates B2/B3, not emitted into the manifest). A note whose title/summary reads as an
absence claim without declaring `absent:` is listed as a checker WARN — prism's
worklist, never a gate failure (a heuristic that fails the gate would be an assumed
value).

**Lifecycle — retirement is a TOMBSTONE, never a deletion (owner 2026-07-27
r7c).** Notes accept optional `status: active | retired` (absent = active; the
gate rejects any other value; `retired` rides the manifest). A note whose
knowledge no longer holds KEEPS its file: set `status: retired` and append a
dated `## Retired` body section — why, and what (if anything) supersedes it
(`superseded by [new-note](/brain/rules/new-note.md)`). Retired notes are
excluded from recall serving (a retired note in recall misleads) but remain in
the bundle as history — continuity is the product. The same law binds every
generated type: improvements close via `status: fixed|wontfix` plus a dated
closure line in the body; a state change is never recorded by removing a file.

---

## 3. Improvement files — `improve/improvements/*.md`

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
id: dead-model-options-google-crewai # required · == filename stem
priority: P1 # required · P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
category: product # required · security|correctness|performance|architecture|product|ops
status: open # required · open | backlog | fixed | wontfix
title: Two of the four model options are dead and fail silently # required
summary: google_genai and crewai route to unwired agents # required
fix: Wire both agents in main.py, or remove them from the picker # required
leverage: { impact: high, effort: low } # required · impact/effort ∈ low|medium|high
blast_radius: [web-agent-bridge, external-integrations] # optional · default []
cites: # required · ≥ 1
  - src/components/ModelSelector.tsx:25 :: google_genai
found: 2026-07-02 # optional · ISO date
---
（prose body）
```

Note: `title`, `summary`, `fix` are now **required frontmatter** — previously scraped
from prose. That scraping is gone; these are authored values.

`category` is the canonical field name (2026-07-26). The pre-rename name `lens`
is accepted as a **deprecated alias** by the compile gate (`category ?? lens`,
same enum); the manifest carries both keys during the transition. New files
author `category:` only.

---

## 4. Health file — `brain/checklist.md`

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
verdict: PASS # required · PASS | ITERATE
score: 95 # required · 0–100
gates: { fidelity: pass, coverage: pass } # required · each pass | fail
counts: { blockers: 0, majors: 0, minors: 2 } # required · non-negative ints
---
（prism report body）
```

---

## 5. Ledger file — `improve/ledger.md`

The debt figure is **authored in frontmatter** (bloom's number), not parsed from a
table. `open`/`by_priority` are cross-checked against the improvement rows at ingest.
Flat keys only — no nesting (compile maps `debt_score`→`debtScore`, `by_priority`→`byPriority`).

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
open: 7
debt_score: 13
by_priority: { P0: 0, P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 3 }
---
（human-readable trend/tables in the body）
```

---

## 6. Coverage file — `brain/coverage.md`

The scan's breadth report. `domains` is a **flow map** of `domain: status`, one entry per
domain found (compile emits it as `[{ domain, status }]` in the manifest). Status enum:
`mapped | thin | stubbed | empty`. The body holds the human per-criterion PASS/FAIL narrative.

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
domains: { design-system: mapped, components: mapped, api: thin, external-integrations: empty }
inventory:                       # optional · declared surface inventories, re-counted by
  - route-pages :: apps/web/app/**/page.tsx :: 23      # the checker every run
  - api-routes :: apps/web/app/api/**/route.ts :: 2
---
（per-criterion PASS/FAIL narrative in the body）
```

`inventory:` entries are `<name> :: <glob> :: <count>` — the checker recomputes each
count via `git ls-files ':(glob)<glob>'` and FAILS on drift (coverage claiming a
surface inventory the repo has outgrown). atlas declares one per framework surface it
maps (route pages, API routes, workflows — whatever the repo's shape makes load-bearing);
compile validates the grammar, the checker owns the truth.

---

## 7. Plan files — `plans/**/*.md` (+ the plans channel) — **v2: the work-item tree**

Plans are a TREE of work items (plans data version 2, ratified 2026-07-12): one
**epic** (the root) → **tasks** → **subtasks**. Three ranks, deliberately matching
the ceiling of Linear (Project→Issue→sub-issue), Jira (Epic→Task→Sub-task), and
Asana (Project→Task→Subtask) so tracker sync is lossless. Vocabulary is
vendor-blended: field names below are the majority vendor names wherever one exists.
Each item owns exactly one file (merges never conflict; progress is derived).

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
id: payments-c3-webhooks # required · == filename stem · GLOBALLY unique across plans/**
plan: payments # required · the ROOT (epic) id
parent: payments-c3 # required · the parent ITEM id (any rank above), or null (epic)
kind: epic | task | subtask # required · epic = root only · task's parent = the epic · subtask's parent = a task
title: Handle provider webhooks # required · WHAT (Linear title · Jira summary · Asana name)
description:
  >- # optional · WHY + context — syncs 1:1 with vendor description/notes
  reconciliation must be automatic; manual matching doesn't scale
approach: verify HMAC → enqueue → idempotent apply # optional · HOW, one line — rafa value-add
status: todo | in-progress | done | superseded | abandoned # required (task/subtask); epic may omit
assignee: rohik # optional · WHO (free string pre-orgs; unanimous vendor word)
blocked_by: [payments-c2] # optional · item ids this waits on — a dependency IS a blocker
blocked_reason: "vendor sandbox access" # optional · external blocks (no dependency id to point at)
priority: 2 # optional · 0 none · 1 urgent · 2 high · 3 medium · 4 low (Linear scale)
estimate: 3 # optional · points (Linear estimate / Jira story points)
validation_tier: standard # optional · light|standard|full — bounds prism's re-derivation DEPTH only (wave 5); the Done-check gate itself never relaxes. Planner assigns from blast radius: contract/state/graph surface → full · types/docs/leaf-UI → light · default standard
branch: feat/webhooks # optional · ↔ Linear branchName
baseSha: abc123 # optional · commit it was cut from
domains: [payments] # optional · EPIC only · the blast radius — the brain link
external: { provider: jira, key: PAY-142 } # optional · tracker identity — READ-ONLY to sessions
---
（prose body — a LEAF item (a task with no subtasks, or a subtask) MUST carry a
`## Done-check`; `## Log` is the execution journal; `## Decisions` mirrors the
structured decision records (below). Compile never parses bodies.）
```

Rules (all compile-enforced unless noted):

- **Global id uniqueness** across `plans/**` (duplicate = error). Convention: prefix
  descendants with the epic id.
- **Tree shape.** Exactly ONE `kind: epic` per plan; `epic` → `parent: null`, `plan == id`.
  A task's `parent` is the epic; a subtask's `parent` is a task. Every item's `plan`
  is the root epic id. Dangling parents and rank violations are loud errors.
- **`blocked` is DERIVED, never stored.** An item is blocked when it has an
  unresolved `blocked_by` (a listed item not yet `done`) or a `blocked_reason`.
  `status: blocked` is a compile ERROR (removed in v2 — `rafa migrate` converts).
  No vendor stores blocked as a state either (Linear: relations · Jira: links +
  Flagged · Asana: dependencies) — deriving it keeps sync lossless.
- **`blocked_by` ids resolve within the plan and are acyclic.**
- **Progress is never stored.** A `progress` key is a compile error. Progress =
  `count(done LEAVES) / count(leaves)` per subtree — derived everywhere.
- **Statuses.** `done` exists only on prism PASS (the execution gate). Terminal:
  `superseded` (replaced by a newer plan) · `abandoned` (deliberately dropped) —
  mapping losslessly to Linear `canceled` / Jira resolution "Duplicate"/"Won't do".
  Statuses are set in sessions; the platform board renders them read-only.
- **`external` is read-only to sessions** — the sync layer owns it. When a provider
  closes a ticket, the item shows DUAL status (provider's + ours); `done` is never
  imported (K6: done is earned, not synced).
- **`active.md` → `activePlanId`.** First line `# <plan-id>` must resolve to a
  `kind: epic`; `# No active plan` / missing file → null.

**Decisions — first-class deliberation records (channel-borne, never frontmatter):**
the frontmatter grammar is flat and bodies are never parsed, so structured decisions
live on the PLATFORM, pushed via `log_decision` at checkpoint moments:
`{ item, at, actor, context, options[], decision, rationale }` — _actor_ is who
decided (the dev for steering; the agent for proposals it made under standing
consent). Text fidelity: **paraphrase + short verbatim quotes only where the exact
wording carries the decision** (transcripts never land in shared stores). Sessions
mirror each record into the item body's `## Decisions` for human reading. On tracker
sync, decisions flow OUT as prefixed comments (Jira/Linear comments, Asana stories);
imported comments are never scraped into decisions.

**Transport — the plans channel (plans never ride the brain manifest):**

- **Authoring**: files above, compile-validated; `.rafa/plans/` is the working copy.
- **Push on approval**: approval IS the trigger — `push_plan` sends the whole tree
  (`items[]`, bodies included); `set_active_plan` points the pointer. Build cadence
  re-pushes statuses + `## Log` (`push_plan` / `update_plan_status`) and logs
  decisions (`log_decision`).
- **Pull-based work**: `list_plans` = NAMES ONLY; **"load plan X"** = `get_plan`
  (bodies + decisions) materialized back into `.rafa/plans/` by the session.
- **The brain link**: the epic's `domains:` rides the channel; the plan detail page
  renders the related knowledge beside the tree.
- **Tracker sync (phased)**: `external` identity now → import (a ticket is
  purpose/what, NOT an executable plan — it still flows through plan drafting +
  prism before build) → two-way sync under a field-ownership matrix (provider owns
  ticket-native fields; rafa owns execution fields; conflicts surface, never
  auto-resolve).

---

## 8. Versioning & the validate-and-correct loop

- **`schemaVersion`** bumps when this contract changes incompatibly. Ingest refuses
  an unknown version (surfaced error) rather than mis-reading it. **Additive OPTIONAL
  fields do NOT bump it** — e.g. the note size stamps (`bodyTokens`,
  `cites[].targetTokens`, §1): ingest tolerates their absence, so a legacy manifest
  without them stays valid at the same `schemaVersion`.
- **The reconciliation schema ladder (0.11.0 — owner's 4-case doctrine).** When a
  version bump DOES ship, distillation is the upgrade moment — the reconciler
  resolves target-vs-source-vs-runner before judging: target below source → full
  target rewrite onto the newer schema; source below target → incoming candidates
  lift before judging; both equal-but-old → the merged target rewrites onto the
  runner's latest; both current → plain diff (today). Either side newer than the
  runner → **abort loudly** (update the runner; knowledge is never downgraded).
  Transforms are registered per step AND per OKF type in the CLI
  (`lib/distiller/schema-ladder.mjs`): each step declares rule · playbook · improvement
  explicitly — a function, or the EXPLICIT `"unchanged"` (still re-stamps the note's
  `schemaVersion:`); an unregistered step or class fails loudly — the ladder never
  guesses a schema. Class resolves by CHAIN: the governed directory first (inside the
  transport the path IS identity — the CAS row key), then the portable filename suffix
  (`.rule.md` · `.playbook.md` · `.improvement.md`) for files travelling outside the
  canonical tree; a contradiction between the two is a loud error. Only durable
  knowledge migrates; derived/generated files
  (coverage · checklist · ledger · reports · the manifest) regenerate at the new schema.
- **Validate-and-correct:** `rafa compile` validates every file. On failure it emits
  a structured error — `path · field · rule` — to the **authoring agent** (atlas for
  notes, bloom for improvements/ledger, prism for checklist). The agent edits the
  file and compile re-runs. Bounded retries; if it can't converge, a **hard failure**
  blocks the push (better than a silently-wrong brain).
- The validator **reports, never auto-fills** a required value.

---

## 9. The read side — knowledge MCP (platform-served)

The platform serves the **ingested** brain to any MCP client (the build agent, a
teammate's session, Slack/incident.io agents) — the read-side twin of this contract.
One backend: the platform. Local files are the _authoring_ surface; the platform is
the _serving_ surface, and it serves only what passed compile + ingest.

**Envelope — mandatory on every tool response:**

```jsonc
{
  "source": "platform",
  "brainForSha": "<snapshot codeSha>", // the ingested manifest's codeSha — one source
  "ingestedAt": "<ISO time of ingest>",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "synthesized": false, // raw tools: always false
}
```

**Error semantics (no assumed values, outward):** snapshot has an `ingestError` →
every tool returns that error loudly, never partial data. Repo connected but never
pushed (no snapshot) → `"no brain ingested — run rafa push"`. Invalid/mismatched key
→ loud auth error, never a fallback. Empty search → empty result, never a stretched
match.

**Tools (read-only — ALL writes flow files → compile → push → ingest):**

| Tool                                            | Args                                      | Returns                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `get_plan`                                      | `repo`, `id` (parent or child)            | parent + all children **with stored bodies** + **derived** progress; a child id resolves the whole plan with `requestedChild` set — this is what "load plan X" materializes into `.rafa/plans/` |

`repo` is OPTIONAL on every tool — the scope is DERIVED from the per-repo key
(the key IS the repo identity; a derivation from an authenticated fact, never an
assumed value). When provided it must match the registered id exactly — loud
mismatch, never a fallback. Sessions that pass it read the id from the committed
`rafa.json` `repoId`, never a folder name. `branch` is reserved (branch-keyed
instances land in Slice 2 — third-party clients default to the production brain,
i.e. the default branch's instance).

**Search = deterministic lexical retrieval; the server retrieves, the agent decides.**
Fields searched per type — rule/playbook: `title, summary, domain, type` ·
improvement: `title, summary, category, blast_radius` · plan: `title, plan, parent`.
Score = Σ over matched case-folded query tokens of field weight (`title` 3 ·
`domain`/`category`/`blast_radius`/`type`/`plan`/`parent` 2 · `summary` 1); tie-break
score desc then id asc; fields a type lacks are omitted, never defaulted. Candidates
carry `matchKind: "lexical"` (`"semantic"` reserved).

**`ask_knowledge` — the guarded synthesis read (the reserved id, filled 2026-07-13
per the served-brain spec).** For THIN clients (Slack bots, dashboards); full agents
should prefer `search_knowledge` + `get_*` and compose with their own model. The
guarantees, in order: 0. **Enumerable intents route deterministically BEFORE retrieval** — command-shaped
asks ("list improvements [open|P0]", "list plans", "status/health", "coverage")
return the actual rows (`retrieval.matchKind: "intent"`, `items[]`), no LLM
involved. Interrogatives (how/why/where/when) always retrieve instead — a missed
intent degrades to search; a wrong intent would answer the wrong thing.

1. **Retrieval first, deterministic** — the same lexical scorer, top-K candidates.
2. **Empty = honest empty**: `{answer: null, synthesized: false, found: 0}` with a
   "no knowledge found" message — never composed from general knowledge; the empty
   ask is logged into the same knowledge-gaps feed as an empty search
   (`payload.via: "ask"`).
3. **Composition uses retrieved cited notes ONLY**; answers are marked
   `synthesized: true` and carry `citations[]` ({id, title, kind, domain?, path}).
4. **Raw mode**: with no org synthesis key configured, returns `rawMode: true` +
   the top cited candidates (no LLM call) — the surface degrades to search, never
   to silence or invention.
5. **Custody**: synthesis runs on the ORG'S OWN LLM key (a platform tokens row,
   provider `anthropic`, encrypted at rest, decrypted per call server-side, never
   logged). Usage is metered to `usageEvents` (purpose `ask`, runner `platform`).
6. **Caps are loud**: a per-repo daily cap returns an explicit error, never a
   silent throttle.

**Auth:** per-repo machine keys, minted on the platform, sent as
`Authorization: Bearer`. **Rotation is zero-downtime by design:** keys COEXIST —
mint the replacement, update the configs (settings.local.json · credentials.json ·
CI secrets), then revoke the old at leisure; revoke stays an immediate kill (a
security act, never graced). A live session holds its connect-time key — reconnect
the rafinery MCP server (or restart the session) after swapping; the CLI tools
(checkpoint · hydrate · distill) resolve credentials fresh per invocation and are
never stale. Keys are stored hashed platform-side and live client-side in
`~/.config/rafinery/credentials.json` — never inside the code repo or this brain repo.

**Client wiring (written by `rafa init`, secret-free where committed):** a key is
minted at setup generation and delivered consume-once through the setup fetch;
`.mcp.json` (committed) registers the `rafinery` server with
`Authorization: Bearer ${RAFA_MCP_KEY}` env expansion; the raw key lands in
`.claude/settings.local.json` `env` (gitignored) and `~/.config/rafinery/credentials.json`
(0600). Teammates mint their own key on the platform (repo → Agent access).

### §9 addendum — state-plane tools (three-store model, working-set architecture)

The knowledge plane stays strictly read-only (org-brain writes go ONLY through

State tools work with or without an ingested brain (a working set can exist —
and a plan can be pushed — before the first scan) and are exempt from the
snapshot/ingestError gates. `get_plan`/`get_active_plan` share this exemption
(plans are work objects, not snapshot-derived knowledge). The retired
bucket-note tools (`stage/list/resolve_bucket_note`, pre-0.4.0) are superseded
by the working-set tools.

**Typed candidates (capture-engine P2, additive).** A working-set row's KIND
derives from its path — never from a parallel field that could drift:
`brain/rules|playbooks/**` = **note** (§2, judged on "does the claim hold?");
`improve/improvements/**` = **improvement** (§3, judged on the LIFECYCLE —
"is the defect actually gone / does it actually exist on merged main?"; the
row resolution stays the standard enum, the verdict note carries
`confirmed-fixed` / `still-open` / `opened`); `intent/**` = **intent record**
(the post-commit hook's per-commit provenance — consumed at merge, never
judged, never authored into the org brain). `improve/ledger.md` is DERIVED
and never a candidate. schemaVersion stays 1 — this section is purely
additive (§8).

## 10. Agent cards — `../.claude/agents/*.md` (local gate)

The shipped agents are contract-governed artifacts: every card is validated by
`rafa compile` (a malformed agent fails the gate) but never enters `manifest.json`.
No assumed values — applied to the agents themselves.

```yaml
---
name: prism                 # required · MUST equal filename stem
version: 0.4.0              # required · semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
model: opus                 # required · non-empty (trailing # comment = the why)
groundTruth: code-vs-claim  # required · code-at-sha | code-vs-claim | code-trend | sessions-over-time
description: >-             # required · non-empty (folded scalar allowed, §0)
  …
tools: Read, Grep, …        # required · non-empty
color: orange               # optional
duties:                     # required · block list, ≥ 1 · each a duty DSL string
  - <duty> :: <sop-path> :: <bar>
---
```

**Duty DSL** (one string per duty, split on `::`, exactly three parts):

- `duty` — kebab-case name of the responsibility.
- `sop-path` — path relative to the CODE repo root (e.g.
  `.claude/skills/rafa-validate/SKILL.md`); the file MUST exist at compile time (a
  duty without a procedure is a claim, not a contract). Legacy `.rafa/`-relative
  paths (pre-0.4.0 `capabilities/*.md`) still resolve during the migration window.
- `bar` — the explicit pass/fail sentence for this duty. Never empty: a duty whose
  bar can't be stated can't be validated, so it doesn't ship.

Versioning: bump `version:` with any card change; record the _why_ outside the card
(cards ship to end users and stay clean of build-log clutter).

---

## 11. The OKF surface — every generated `.md` self-describes

**Ratified 2026-07-15 (owner decision, `.fable/decisions.md`).** The [Open
Knowledge Format v0.1](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf)
is the interchange **floor** of everything rafa generates (pinned ONCE as
`OKF_VERSION` in `@rafinery/okf` — machine surfaces interpolate it, never
re-declare it); this contract stays the strict **ceiling**. The protocol in one sentence: *if rafa writes a `.md`,
it is a valid OKF concept — frontmatter, `type`, markdown links, cited — and a
pushed brain repo IS a conformant OKF v0.1 bundle any foreign consumer can read
without rafa tooling.* The format machinery is the `@rafinery/okf` package
(strict parser · concept primitives · links · citations · indexes · validator ·
generator); the gate, the emitter, and the platform all parse through it.

**The emit step (`rafa okf`, run inside `rafa push` BEFORE the gates so its
output is validated like any authored file):**

- **Stamps** — missing `type` / `title` / `description` / `timestamp` / `tags`
  are added ONLY where derivable: `description` from `summary`; singleton
  `type`/`title` from the file-class registry (`Coverage Report` ·
  `Health Report` · `Improvement Ledger`; improvements → `Improvement`; plan
  items → `Plan Epic|Task|Subtask` derived from `kind` (§7 files ride the
  brain-repo transport, so they carry the surface; per-epic `plans/index.md`);
  notes keep their authored §2 enum — those ARE valid OKF types); `timestamp` from
  authored `created:`/`found:` verbatim, else brain-repo git history, else the
  emit run itself (a fresh file IS changing now). **Authored values are never
  rewritten; a value that cannot be derived is omitted** — the no-assumed-values
  law applied to interchange. Stamped fields are OPTIONAL at compile and
  validated when present — additive per §8, so **`schemaVersion` stays 1** and
  the manifest shape is untouched.
- **Links** — bodies use standard **bundle-relative markdown links**
  (`[Title](/brain/rules/<id>.md)`), the OKF §5.1 recommended form. Legacy
  `[[wikilinks]]` are transpiled at emit when the id resolves; a dangling link
  is *not-yet-written knowledge* (OKF §5.3): the checker lists it in a
  non-failing **LINKS warn lane** — prism's worklist, never a gate failure.
  `links:` frontmatter stays the machine edge list (graph without body parsing).
- **Citations** — the `cites:` DSL stays the machine truth; emit renders a
  generated `# Citations` section (OKF §8) inside `okf:citations` markers —
  sha-pinned GitHub URLs when the repo is known, plain locators otherwise.
  Generated body sections are display-only: the body is still NEVER parsed for
  data (§0 holds).
- **Indexes** — an `index.md` in every concept directory + the bundle root
  (OKF §6 progressive disclosure): a foreign agent reaches any concept from the
  root in ≤ 2 hops. `index.md` and `log.md` are **reserved names** — never
  concept documents, skipped by every walker. The ROOT index alone carries
  frontmatter: `okf_version: "0.1"` + provenance (`repo` · `codeSha`) — bundle
  freshness rides here, pinned to the code sha.

**Conformance:** `rafa okf check` walks OKF §9 over the bundle (every
non-reserved `.md` parses + carries a non-empty `type`). **Strictness is
total, TypeScript-style:** every `.md` class rafa touches is in the file-type
registry with a schema or a declared class; unregistered shapes fail loudly
(`*.theirs.md` → the typed conflict rule), and shipped SOPs + sage learnings
are compile-gated in the code repo alongside the agent cards. **Documented
exceptions**, passed as explicit exemptions and surfaced as warnings, never
silently skipped: `active.md` (one-line pointer protocol) and `log.md` heading
decoration (our date-led `## YYYY-MM-DD — …` headings stay; OKF prefers bare
dates).

**Minting a new file type** (`rafa okf new` + the
[rafa-okf skill](../skills/rafa-okf/SKILL.md)): a class = one registry entry in
`@rafinery/okf`'s rafa profile + a row in the file-type registry above + a
compile validator. The generator refuses to invent values — flags you omit are
absent and compile fails required ones loudly (the validate-and-correct loop,
not a generator bug).

**Fleet adoption:** every agent that authors `.md` carries an `okf-surface`
duty in its card (§10) pointing at the rafa-okf SOP — atlas (notes · coverage),
bloom (improvements · ledger), prism (checklist + validation lens), sage
(learnings); the conductor's verbs inherit it via the verb-map note (plans ·
journals). compass carries `okf-awareness`: it writes platform state, never
bundle files, and owns the PORTABILITY law — bundles are exchangeable by
design, so person-scoped content never lands in one.

## 12. The guarded loop — moments · signals · gates · lanes  (capture doctrine, consolidated 2026-07-27)

The owner's laws, ratified across `.fable/decisions.md` 2026-07-26/27 (r2–r7c),
in one map. Three sentences carry all of it:

1. **Capture is mandatory and mechanical** — session truth NEVER depends on a
   model remembering an SOP line; every path has a deterministic backstop, and
   the final backstop is always the merge (server-side, unskippable).
2. **Continuity is the product** — one concept/issue = one id forever; every
   pass updates in place; closing anything is a TOMBSTONE (status flip + dated
   reason in the body), never a file removal. Lose continuity and "everything
   becomes new — there is no direction."
3. **Security is integral, never an aftermath** — the audit engine fires at
   plan, build, scan, and EVERY merge level, transparently.

### 12.1 The five guarded moments

| Moment | Layer | What fires — and what it guarantees |
|---|---|---|
| **develop** (each edit) | harness sensor (agent sessions) | PostToolUse appends to the dirty queue (`.rafa/dirty.jsonl`) — the touched-code signal. Manual edits are covered later by git's own diff (see checkpoint). |
| **commit** | git hook (any workflow) | `post-commit` mirrors `.rafa/` 1-1 onto the brain branch (`code-commit:` trailer = the join key). A mirror failure is LOUD (repair command printed, sensor-error recorded) — never silent. |
| **checkpoint** (task boundary + pre-push) | CLI (`rafa checkpoint`) | (a) syncs the branch working set (CAS); (b) **converges reported improvement flips** into real ledger files (overlay → hydrate → status flip); (c) **compulsorily hydrates** every note citing touched code — dirty queue ∪ `git diff <trunk>...HEAD`, so manual edits count — so affected-note edits happen DURING development; (d) pushes the sensor heartbeat. |
| **push** | git hook (any workflow) | `rafa guard --pre-push` FIRST: every outgoing commit must have its brain mirror — self-heal, then **BLOCK** on genuine capture loss (git-local check; `RAFA_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` = the on-the-record escape hatch). Then checkpoint + durable brain-branch push. |
| **merge** (every level) | platform (unskippable) | Branch→branch: fold + the platform-side dep audit (`securityReports`, `source: branch-osv`). Merge→prod: the full reconciliation (§12.3) + the in-graph security lane. This moment needs NO dev-side state — it is why nothing can be lost. |

**The trunk is the configurable prod branch, never a hardcoded `main`.** Every
moment above resolves it dynamically — `trunkBranchOf` (stamped `prodBranch` →
`origin/HEAD` → `main` only as the last-resort fallback for an unconfigured
repo); the merge lane keys on the merge event's actual target branch. A repo
whose default is `develop`/`release`/anything is guarded identically. Feature→
feature merges and feature→prod merges both fire the affected sweep and the
parallel-brain guard against that repo's real trunk manifest.

### 12.2 The signals (computed, never self-reported promises)

- **dirty queue** — touched code files → citing notes (local manifest), the
  staleness/hydration driver.
- **reported overlays** — `report_improvement_status` events vs canonical rows;
  a mismatch = a flip not yet converged. Self-converging: once the row matches,
  the overlay disappears. The tool's response carries `required_next` (hydrate →
  flip → checkpoint) so the SOP enforces itself at the moment of use.
- **sensor heartbeat** — per-hook wired/lastFire/lastError, pushed at every
  checkpoint; the platform's view of whether the dev-side gates are alive.
- **capture-trust** (per merge, computed at dispatch) — trusted ⇔ the working-set
  checkpoint arrived AND the heartbeat is fresh (≤7d) with wired, error-free
  post-commit/pre-push hooks. Conservative by construction: **no signal = no
  trust**. Gates the affected-notes sweep (§12.3).

### 12.3 Reconciliation — the lanes of one merge

`gather → classify → { atlas⇄prism · bloom · security-audit } → manifest (defer join) → push`

- **Candidates** = the branch's working set (DB plane) or the brain-branch diff
  (git plane), **∪ reported overlays** (deterministic status-flip candidates
  built from the trunk copy — dead hooks lose nothing), **∪ the affected
  sweep** when capture is untrusted: merge-changed code ∩ trunk-manifest
  citations → every affected note joins as `affected` and is RE-GROUNDED on the
  record ("re-verified", or judged when citations broke).
- **classify** (deterministic rigor gradient, both lanes): identical → "already
  banked" (CAS no-op) · updated+grounded → fold latest-wins · new+grounded →
  bank — **but first the PARALLEL-BRAIN GUARD**: a NEW note/improvement
  overlapping an existing one (same domain/category + equal title OR ≥50%
  shared cited files vs the trunk manifest) goes CONTESTED — fold into the
  existing id or defend a genuinely new one; duplicates never bank silently ·
  deleted+code-gone → **prune = TOMBSTONE WRITE** (`status: retired`/`fixed` +
  dated reason citing the merge sha — the file is never removed) · anything
  broken/ambiguous → CONTESTED for the lane's judge (atlas | bloom), who also
  tombstones refutations.
- **security lane** — deterministic, LLM-free, dependency tier: lockfile at the
  merge sha (any manager, §12.5) → OSV → a `securityReports` row. NEVER
  load-bearing: every failure is `ran:false + reason` in the step timeline.
- The org brain has ONE writer — this reconciler. The session-distill verb is
  retired; `rafa distill --headless` (org-CI, own key) is the sole other adapter.

### 12.4 Continuity laws (scan · improve · every pass)

- **Step 0, always**: `rafa pull --full` + confirm `.rafa` at the brain
  remote's HEAD before scanning or improving. **Founding is PLATFORM truth**
  (zero knowledge served) — local emptiness proves nothing.
- **Ids are stable forever**; refresh = update in place; new ids only for
  genuinely new concepts (say why in the body); triage (backlog/wontfix) and
  trends are never reset.
- **Tombstones** (§2 lifecycle): notes retire via `status: retired` + a dated
  `## Retired` section (superseded-by linked); improvements close via
  `status: fixed|wontfix` + a dated closure line with evidence. Recall excludes
  tombstones ("history, not truth"); `verify-citations` skips them (their dead
  citations are the record of what they once claimed).

### 12.5 Security, woven (never a dev verb)

`rafa audit` (rafa.audit/v1) is SELF-CONTAINED — built-in lockfile parsing
(pnpm · npm · yarn · bun, resolved dynamically) + keyless OSV + the built-in
secrets ruleset; semgrep/gitleaks are optional enhancers; nothing is ever
bundled or installed. It fires: **plan** (before approval, presented verbatim —
"clean" is said out loud) · **build** (lockfile-touching tasks re-run the dep
tier, delta reported in one line) · **scan/improve** (full three-tier profile →
`category: security` rows, mechanical priority map, P0s travel outside the
blast radius) · **every merge** (§12.1/§12.3). `rafa doctor` fails a
`package.json` repo with no lockfile and prints the per-manager generate
command — coverage is never silently absent.

This contract is the thing to test against.
